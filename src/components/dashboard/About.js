                                    My name is Connor and Movietime is my place to share my love for movies with all of you, but it is also for myself so i can remember all the different kinds
                    of movies and remember exactly what I felt when I saw the different movies. <br /><br />
                    I am a former actor so i know a lot about how good structured and hard the industry can be, and therefore i also have a lot of understanding towards movies and series.
